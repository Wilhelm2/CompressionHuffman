Small project implementing the [Huffman compresssion algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) in C.
The project contains the code required to compress and decompress files using Huffman coding:
* The executable **huffmanCompression** contains the executable to compress files.
* The executable **huffmanDecompression** contains the executable to decompress files.
